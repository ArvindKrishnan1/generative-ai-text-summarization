Here are the instructions for setting up the exact environment:

1. Pyenv Installation: 
   - Install `pyenv` by following the instructions on their GitHub page: [pyenv GitHub](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation).
   - After installation, verify that `pyenv` is properly set up by running `pyenv --version`.

2. Project Folder Creation:
   - Initially created a new github repository and then created folders and files from there

3. Virtual Environment Creation:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
   - Run the following commands to create a virtual environment using `pyenv` and `virtualenv`:
     ```
     pyenv install 3.10.13  # Install Python 3.10.13
     pyenv virtualenv 3.10.13 myenv  # Create a virtual environment named 'myenv' with Python 3.10.13
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```
     pyenv activate myenv
     ```
   - Confirm that the correct Python version is being used by running `python --version`, which should display Python 3.10.13.

4. Environment Configuration File:
   - Create an `requirements.txt` file to document the exact environment setup.

   - Save the file in the config folder in the project folder.
